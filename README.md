## WHY ? to choose this Project
Farming is a vital sector that greatly influences a country's economic growth.

- In countries like India, a significant portion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. To assist farmers in boosting their productivity and yields, advanced technologies such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning are being applied to agricultural practices.

- This project showcases a website with three primary applications: Crop Recommendation, Fertilizer Recommendation, and Plant Disease Detection.

- The Crop Recommendation application allows users to input soil data, and based on this information, the application suggests the most suitable crops to cultivate.

- In the Fertilizer Recommendation application, users can enter soil data along with the type of crop they are growing. The application will then analyze the soil's nutrient profile and recommend necessary fertilizers to balance the soil composition.

- The Plant Disease Detection application lets users upload images of diseased plant leaves. The application diagnoses the disease, provides a brief description, and suggests possible treatments to manage and cure the disease.

## How to use ðŸ’»
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer this website for more information. Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the Weather API from where humidity, temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System ==> Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly. Note that, for now it only supports few crops.
